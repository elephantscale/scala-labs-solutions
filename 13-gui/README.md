# Simple ScalaFX popup


## STEP 1: Try simple popup example

* In a separate directory, run the following command


    sbt new scalafx/scalafx.g8

* It will create a directory
* Go inside this directory and run the command

      sbt run

* Enjoy the popup

## STEP 2: Try more realistic examples

* Clone a sample project. In a new directory, run


    git clone https://github.com/scalafx/ScalaFX-Tutorials.git

    `cd` hello-sbt

     sbt run


* More example

* `cd` into other directories of your choice
* Once there, run

       sbt run
